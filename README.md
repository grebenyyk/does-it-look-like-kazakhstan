# does-it-look-like-kazakhstan

An interactive map that rates countries on how much they look like Kazakhstan.

## Usage

Open [index.html](index.html) in your web browser to view the map. Each country is color-coded based on how similar it looks to Kazakhstan, with darker blue indicating greater similarity.

## How It Works

The application uses:
- **D3.js** for data visualization
- **TopoJSON** for geographical data
- **Datamaps** for interactive world map rendering

Countries are rated on a scale from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate greater visual similarity to Kazakhstan.
